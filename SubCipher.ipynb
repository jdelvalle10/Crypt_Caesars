It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.\n\nFirst described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, the cipher is easy to understand and implement, but it resisted all attempts to break it until 1863, three centuries later. This earned it the description le chiffrage indéchiffrable (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers. In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering Vigenère ciphers.",

GIOVAN BATTISTA BELLASO.[8] HE BUILT UPON THE TABULA RECTA OF TRITHEMIUS BUT ADDED A REPEATING \"COUNTERSIGN\" (A KEY) TO SWITCH CIPHER ALPHABETS EVERY LETTER. WHEREAS ALBERTI AND TRITHEMIUS USED A FIXED PATTERN OF SUBSTITUTIONS, BELLASO\\'S SCHEME MEANT THE PATTERN OF SUBSTITUTIONS COULD BE EASILY CHANGED, SIMPLY BY SELECTING A NEW KEY. KEYS WERE TYPICALLY SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES, KNOWN TO BOTH PARTIES IN ADVANCE, OR TRANSMITTED \"OUT OF BAND\" ALONG WITH THE MESSAGE.
